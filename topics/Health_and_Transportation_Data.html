and public health data can be broadly categorized into three groups: data describing the built environment and transportation system, measures of transportation-related exposures and transportation behaviors that impact health, and measures of health outcomes associated with transportation-related exposures and transportation behaviors. Data sources are discussed for these broad categories below.</p> <h2 id="built-environment-and-transportation-system-characteristics"><a href="#built-environment-and-transportation-system-characteristics" class="header-anchor">#</a> Built Environment and Transportation System Characteristics</h2> <h3 id="transportation-infrastructure-roadways"><a href="#transportation-infrastructure-roadways" class="header-anchor">#</a> Transportation Infrastructure: Roadways</h3> <p>Physical and operational characteristics of the transportation system influence transportation health impacts. At a national level, the Highway Performance Monitoring Systems (HPMS) compiles data on roadway network extent, use, condition, and performance. The HPMS is focused on motorized travel and does not capture detailed roadway characteristics, such as the presence of sidewalk and bike lanes, that may be relevant to public health. More detailed roadway characteristic data may be available at the local level via local governments or municipal planning organizations. Additionally, the 2nd Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) Roadway Information Database (RID) provides detailed road segment data in six major areas (Tampa, FL; Bloomington, IN; Buffalo, NY; Raleigh/Durham, NC; State College, PA; and Seattle. WA). Increasingly, mapping services like Google Maps and OpenStreetMap are integrating more detailed bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure information. Further, OpenSidewalks is working to standardize and improve sidewalk data within OpenStreetMap. Data collection to support these data can include cell phone apps to encourage citizen data contributions, such as <a href="http://transportation.ce.gatech.edu/node/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sidewalk Scout<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.

As real-time transit service applications became more popular, the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) was developed to provide a consistent format for transit agencies to provide stop, route, and scheduled service information to third parties, such as Google Maps. USDOT has developed the National Transit Map to make GTFS data voluntarily provided by local transit agencies generally available to the public. The National Transit Map is a nationwide catalog of fixed-guideway and fixed-route transit service data, including transit stop, route, and schedules information. Because transit agencies are not required to report to USDOT via the GTFS, data coverage is inconsistent nationally and data quality, especially for route information, varies substantially between agencies. While GTFS is limited to fixed-route transit service, GTFS-flex is an extension currently in development to extend GTFS capabilities to include demand-responsive transit services.

While walking and biking trips may be recorded directly when a respondent completes the travel survey, respondents may walk or bike intermittently and these trips may not be recorded. However, travel diaries may not capture all walking and biking trips to and from public transit. Travel surveys such the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) have supplemented travel diaries with questions asking respondents about the frequency of walking and biking trips over longer periods of time, such as walking trips in a typical week. Similarly, travel surveys may also contain questions to capture longer-term driving behaviors, such as per-capita yearly vehicle-miles travelled. The quality and depth of household travel surveys, especially at the local level, vary greatly. The NHTS offers a detailed, high-quality snapshot of travel behavior across the United States; however, it is administered infrequently.

Methods such as machine learning have been explored to derive activities from patterns of accelerometer readings, but consistent methods to do so are not readily available. GPS-based devices record location in real-time and typically prompt a user to enter the beginning and end of an activity, such as a bike ride, to identify the specific activity.

The FARS database, maintained by NHTSA, records the location of every fatal crash involving a motor vehicle traveling on a public roadway in the United States on a yearly basis. Motorist, passenger, pedestrians and cyclist fatalities are included. Each crash record contains additional supplemental information on vehicle, roadway, driver, and victim characteristics. These data can be used to identify high-risk segments of the transportation system, evaluate safety countermeasures, and explore the relationships between traffic fatality risks and other variables. While FARS contains a complete record of crash fatalities, it does not contain complete records of injury crashes or near misses. Thus, in areas where bicycle and pedestrian fatalities are relatively rare, the FARS database may have limited statistical power in identifying high-risk locations or evaluating safety countermeasures. FARS data are published yearly and typically in the latter portion of the year after the year of the dataset (e.g., FARS 2016 data were released in late September of 2017). Thus, some fatalities may not be included until nearly two after the incident. Several states have begun report all motor vehicle crashes to NHTSA into the FARS process shortly after an incident occurs via the Electronic Data Transfer (EDT) pilot program. In addition to FARS and EDT, the Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) contains detailed records for all motor vehicle crashes in seven states (California, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, and Washington). Each HSIS record is geo-coded and contains crash, roadway, and traffic volume data. States may also include roadway curve/grade, intersection, and interchange data as appropriate.

While some transportation health outcomes, such as fatal crashes, are acute, other transportation health impacts are the result of chronic exposure to a stressor. Thus, it can be difficult to attribute specific health problem or mortality risk to a transportation-related exposure. Several types of epidemiology studies are common, including case-control studies, cohort studies, panel studies, and case-crossover studies. Cohort studies follow individuals with varying exposure and estimate the relationship between observed health outcomes in the cohort and observed exposures, controlling for other factors. Panel studies are a longitudinal study where the people are repeatedly followed at intervals over time. Case-control studies use a case as her own control and can be used to compare exposures during a “time window” the onset of an acute health problem (e.g., heart attack or stroke) to a “control window” of time. The resulting evidence links a specific exposure dose to increased (or decreased) risk of a specific health outcome, such as all-cause premature mortality or incidence of lung cancer.

The simplest tools include data warehouses that catalogue transportation and health data sources to empower qualitative assessments of transportation health impacts. More specialized tools and models, such as air quality modes and travel demand models, focus on transportation-related exposures that impact public health. Finally, advanced health impact assessment tools draw on quantitative risk assessment techniques to integrate large amounts of data to quantitatively estimate changes in population health outcomes given changes in the built environment and/or transportation system. These tools and models can be applied at various stages of health impact assessment, a six-step process that identifies and estimates the health impacts of a policy decision, such as investments in transportation infrastructure.

The outputs of travel demand models support estimates of air quality and active transportation behaviors. Traditional four-step travel demand models first generate trips, then distribute these trips between transportation analysis zones (TAZs), then use a model to predict the mode choice for trips, and finally assign trips to the transportation network. These models are typically calibrated using locally-administered household travel surveys. Because four-step travel demand models only estimate trips between TAZs, which may have large spatial extents, they may systematically underestimate short trips that are more likely to be made by active modes, such as walking. However, emerging activity-based travel demand models offer higher-resolution estimates of trip-making, including more detailed estimates of walking and biking trips. An introduction to active-based models can be found at <a href="https://doi.org/10.17226/22357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doi.org/10.17226/22357<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.</p> <h3 id="air-quality-models"><a href="#air-quality-models" class="header-anchor">#</a> Air Quality Models</h3> <p>Air quality models offer higher-resolution estimates of the spatial distribution of pollutes in ambient air than the ambient monitoring network. Two types of air quality models are particularly useful for transportation and public health practitioners: dispersion models and grid models. Dispersion models estimate the dispersion of pollutants emitted from a point or along a line (e.g., a roadway); however, these models only estimate the concertation of primary pollutants emitted from these sources (e.g. particulate matter). Concentrations of secondary pollutants such as ozone, which are formed through chemical reactions in the atmosphere, are not estimated by dispersion models. Grid models divide the atmosphere into nested grid cells and estimate the pollutant concentrations within the smallest nested grids accounting for all sources (i.e., point, line, and area-wide emissions) and photochemistry. Thus, grid models can estimate concentrations of both primary and secondary pollutants. However, the complexity of chemical fate and transport models limits their ability to estimate air quality concentrations at high spatial resolution: dispersion models can be used to estimate concentrations at small scales, such as the centroids of Census blocks, while grid models typically estimate uniform concentrations within 4km grids or larger. While both line-source and photochemical air quality models are computationally intensive and require substantial expertise to execute, results of air quality model runs may be available for use in estimating the health impacts of transportation systems as they are often used to demonstrate conformity with air quality standards.

Some versions of ITHIM also predict changes in CO2 emissions. ITHIM is being used in research and by health and transportation practitioners to estimate the health impacts of scenarios, compare the impact of travel patterns in different places and model the impact of interventions. ITHIM works either as a stand-alone model, or it can be linked with other models (e.g. transport, health, economic).

Physical activity trackers, such as accelerometers, have been used to collect more detailed physical activity data. However, these collection methods are expensive to deploy and may be effected by selection bias. Passive collection of walking and biking data is increasingly feasible with cell phone-based apps, potentially allowing researchers to recruit large study populations at relatively low cost. Cell phone-based physical activity tracking apps can use both GPS and accelerometer technologies to improve the accuracy of activity tracking, without requiring the user to specify the beginning and end of an activity. Further, these apps can periodically prompt the user to validate activities after they occur and utilize techniques such as machine learning to improve the accuracy of activity tracking for difficult to identify activities, such as biking.</p> <p>In addition to measuring physical activity, cell phones and other mobile sensor networks can better capture transportation system characteristics that may impact public health. Several commercial vendors, including INRIX and AirSage, offer rich datasets capturing population movements, congestion levels, etc. Crowdsourced congestion and incident data, such as Waze, offer transportation researchers and practitioners near real-time data relevant to traffic safety. Waze provides access to portions of their data feed via the Connected Citizens Program: <a href="https://support.google.com/waze/partners/CCP/?hl=en#topic=6324400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://support.google.com/waze/partners/CCP/?hl=en#topic=6324400<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.</p> <h4 id="cell-phone-based-travel-surveys"><a href="#cell-phone-based-travel-surveys" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cell phone-based travel surveys</h4> <p>While household travel surveys have historically relied on paper-and-pencil travel diaries, newer surveys may be supplemented with data collection technologies such as cell phone apps.

A handful of studies have employed methodological techniques, such as surveys to reveal underlying preferences of study participants and/or follow-up with participants who change residential location over time, to build stronger causal evidence. The true causal effect of built environment characteristics on travel behaviors remains uncertain. Because these relationships provide foundational evidence for conducting health impact assessments of changes in the built environment on population health, stronger understanding of how the built environment shapes travel behavior, taking into account effects such as residential self-selection, is a critical future research direction.</p> <h2 id="health-impact-modeling"><a href="#health-impact-modeling" class="header-anchor">#</a> Health Impact Modeling</h2> <h3 id="data-gaps-2"><a href="#data-gaps-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data Gaps</h3> <h4 id="measurement-of-competing-transportation-related-exposures"><a href="#measurement-of-competing-transportation-related-exposures" class="header-anchor">#</a> Measurement of competing transportation-related exposures</h4> <p>Exposure pathways in urban areas are complex and may compete within one another—for example, walking in an urban area may increase physical activity levels but also increase inhalation of pollutants in ambient air. Thus, changes in the transportation system may result in trade-offs between competing risks. Simultaneous measurements of physical activity and air pollution exposure for the same individual are very rare. Supplementing objectively measured physical activity with objectively measured air pollution exposure would provide researchers a rich dataset to better understand the nature of these risk tradeoffs in urban areas.</p> <h4 id="noise-barrier-infrastructure-effects-on-other-exposure-pathways"><a href="#noise-barrier-infrastructure-effects-on-other-exposure-pathways" class="header-anchor">#</a> Noise barrier infrastructure effects on other exposure pathways</h4> <p>While state DOTs often have inventories for noise barriers, there currently is no common database that can be used to estimate how noise barriers might affect exposures to noise and air pollution.</p> <h4 id="different-vocabularies"><a href="#different-vocabularies" class="header-anchor">#</a> Different Vocabularies</h4> <p>Databases for different health outcomes may not be comparable, due to different vocabularies and statistical metrics.

Additionally, biomarkers may help researchers better understand how health effects “ramp up” in the population following a change in exposure—for example, how long an increase in physical activity must be sustained for the full health benefit to be seen in an individual.</p> <h4 id="exposure-mitigation"><a href="#exposure-mitigation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Exposure Mitigation</h4> <p>EPA has published <a href="https://www.epa.gov/schools/best-practices-reducing-near-road-pollution-exposure-schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Practices for Reducing Near-Road Air Pollution Exposures at Schools<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.
